===============
Release History
===============

0.5.0
-----
* Added SegmentationPlugin. This allows to conditionally render parts of the DOM, depending on
  the status of various ``request`` object members, such as ``user``.
* Setting ``CASCADE_LEAF_PLUGINS`` has been replaced by ``CMSPLUGIN_CASCADE_ALIEN_PLUGINS``. This simplifies
  the programming of third party plugins, since the author of a plugin now only must set the member
  ``alien_child_classes = True``.

0.4.5
-----
* Fixed: If no breakpoints are set, don't delete widths and offsets from the glossary, as otherwise
  this information is lost.
* Fixed broken import for ``PageSelectFormField`` when not using **django_select2**.
* Admin form for ``PluginExtraFields`` now is created on the fly. This fixes a rare circular
  dependency issue, when accessing ``plugin_pool.get_all_plugins()``.

0.4.4
-----
* Removed hard coded input fields for styling margins from **BootstrapButtonPlugin**, since
  it is possible to add them through the **Extra Fields** dialog box.
* [Column ordering](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-column-ordering) using ``col-xx-push-n``
  and ``col-xx-pull-n`` has been added.
* Fixed: Media file ``linkplugin.js`` was missing for **BootstrapButtonPlugin**.
* Hard coded configuration option ``EXTRA_INLINE_STYLES`` can now be overridden by the projects
  settings


0.4.3
-----
* The templatetag ``bootstrap3_tags`` and the templates to build Boostrap3 styled menus,
  breadcrumbs and paginator, have been moved into their own repository
  at https://github.com/jrief/djangocms-bootstrap3.
* `Column ordering`_ using ``col-xx-push-n`` and ``col-xx-pull-n`` has been added.

0.4.2
-----
* Fixed: Allow empty setting for CMSPLUGIN_CASCADE_PLUGINS
* Fixed: Use str(..) instead of b'' in combination with from __future__ import unicode_literals

0.4.1
-----
* Fixed: Exception when saving a ContainerPlugin with only one breakpoint.
* The ``required`` flag on a field for an inherited LinkPlugin is set to False for shared settings.
* Fixed: Client side code for disabling shared settings did not work.

0.4.0
-----
* Renamed ``context`` from model ``CascadeElement`` to ``glossary`. The identifier ``context`` lead
  to too much confusion, since it is used all way long in other CMS plugins, where it has a
  complete different meaning.
* Renamed ``partial_fields`` in all plugins to ``glossary_fields``, since that's the model field
  where they keep their information.
* Huge refactoring of the code base, allowing a lot of more features.

0.3.2
-----
* Fixed: Missing unicode conversion for method ``get_identifier()``
* Fixed: Exception handler for form validation used ``getattr`` incorrectly.

0.3.1
-----
* Added compatibility layer for Python-3.3.

0.3.0
-----
* Complete rewrite. Now offers elements for Bootstrap 3 and other CSS frameworks.

0.2.0
-----
* Added carousel.

0.1.2
-----
* Fixed: Added missign migration.

0.1.1
-----
* Added unit tests.

0.1.0
-----
* First published revision.

======

This DjangoCMS plugin originally was derived from https://github.com/divio/djangocms-style, so the
honor for the idea of this software goes to Divio and specially to Patrick Lauber, aka digi604.

However, since my use case is different, I removed all the existing code and replaced it against
something more generic suitable to add a collection of highly configurable plugins.
